	<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
	dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
	a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
	and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
	brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
	stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
	<strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
	off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
	compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about 
	helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
	thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
	room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
	between its four familiar walls.</p>
